# Machine Learning Micro Projects

This is a micro project in which I've coded some of the machine learning algorithms and shows how actually that specific ML algorithm work.

## Thing you'd need to install
- An IDE or an editor. My recommendation is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download/), you can go with any.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Packages
- scikit-learn
```
pip install scikit-learn
```
- pandas
```
pip install pandas
```
- numpy
```
pip install numpy
```
- matplotlib
```
pip install matplotlib
```

## The Plan
The plan is to do all the algorithms, here the existing 
algorithms to write it from scratch and to do it all by our 
own. Like don't use the scikit learn library and it's pre built 
codes and scores function. All in Pythonüêâ.
- The first Linear Regression have been added to the repo all coded from scratch. One thing to mention is that I've done these base on the tutorials of [Sentdex](https://github.com/Sentdex) over youtube. So to know more you can follow along.
